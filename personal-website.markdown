Personal website
----------------
This is the first take on my personal website. The website is for recruitement purposes and should show of my coding skills. 

It has an about section with a profile picture and a short motivation
It has a portfolio section with thumbnails
It has a contact section with a messaging option.
In the footer is a link button to my linkedin, git and angel.

It is meant to have a toggle menu. that scrolls automatically down.
And a message webform (for now my email adres will do)
